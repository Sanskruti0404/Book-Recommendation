📚 Book Recommendation System
📌 Project Overview

This project is a Book Recommendation System that suggests books to users based on their interests and past ratings.
It uses machine learning and data analysis to find similar books and recommend the best ones.

The main goal of this project is to:

Understand how recommendation systems work

Practice data cleaning, analysis, and modeling

Build a simple and useful ML application

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for graphs, if used)

📂 Project Files

Book recommendation system.ipynb → Main notebook with all the code

Dataset files (if any) → Used for training and testing the model

README.md → Project explanation (this file)

⚙️ How It Works (In Simple Words)

Load the book and user data

Clean the data (remove missing or wrong values)

Analyze the data (check popular books, ratings, users, etc.)

Build a recommendation model (for example: based on similarity)

When a user selects a book, the system suggests similar books

▶️ How to Run This Project

Install Python (if not already installed)

Install required libraries:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn


Open Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook


Open the file:

Book recommendation system.ipynb


Run the cells one by one from top to bottom

✅ Example Output

The system will show recommended books based on the selected book or user

You may also see charts and tables for data analysis
